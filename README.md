# About
This is a slightly altered copy of the source code for my site. I cannot publically publish the original source code as it includes mail passwords. I also removed the database and 
info page here as they are constantly being edited and I don't want to leave incorrect or outdated information lying around but both of those are available on the site. 

# Tech stack:     
database: SQLite     
backend: Flask     
frontend: Jinja2, styled with TailwindCSS     
I also used some AJAX to help pass data around a little more cleanly.
